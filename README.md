## Introduction

Planet  earth  is  experiencing  tremendous  global  climate  change  effects  in  forest  fires,  droughts, 
floods,  and  extreme  weather  conditions.  These  impacts  are  mainly  associated  with  increased 
carbon  dioxide,  methane,  and  other  greenhouse  gasses  in  our  atmosphere  caused  by  human 
activities. 
According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the largest source of greenhouse 
gas  (GHG)  emission  in  the  United  States  is  energy  usage,  in  terms  of  burning  fossil  fuels  for 
electricity, heat, and transportation. The rise in energy-related CO2 emissions has pushed 
greenhouse gas emissions from energy to their highest level in 2018. 
This case study presents global trends in net CO2 emission across different continents over time.

## Dataset

In this study we used the [CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions dataset](https://github.com/owid/co2-data), this is a collection of key metrics maintained by Our World in Data. It is updated regularly and includes data on CO2 emissions (annual, per capita, cumulative and consumption-based), other greenhouse gases, energy mix, and other relevant metrics.
